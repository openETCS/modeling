Getting started with the **issue tracker**
============

To execute the entire test suite and generate the test report, change to `$ROOT/test/` and run

`tools/generateTestReport -c -r`

in your terminal.

Now navigate to `$ROOT/tools` and run the command

`python main_issue_tracker.py USERNAME PASSWORD`

to generate the `report.md` file.

Whereby `USERNAME` is your username of your Github account and `PASSWORD` the corresponding password of the account.
