The "Management of Modes and Levels" function is mainly described in chapter 4 and 5 of \citep{subset-026}. Modes and levels define the status of the ETCS
regarding on-board functional status and track infrastructure.

\subsubsection{Reference to the SRS or other Requirements}
See \citep{subset-026} section 5.10

\subsubsection{Short description of the functionality}
The level management subsystem receives level transition order tables and selects the order with the highest probability. It stores the information about the selected transition order and transits to the requested level once the train passes the location of the level transition.

If required, the driver is asked to acknowledge the transition, in case of no acknowledge or if conditions for the level transition are not fulfilled, the train gets tripped.

\subsubsection{Interface}
The interface consists of the following inputs:

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{conditional transitions:} a priority table containing the
  conditional level transition orders (from paquet 46)
\item \emph{level transition priority table:} a priority table containing the
  (non-conditional) level transition orders (from paquet 41)
\item \emph{train standstill:} a Boolean value indicating whether the train is
  at standstill (from odometry)
\item \emph{driver level transition:} a level transition order selected by the
  driver (from DMI)
\item \emph{ERTMS capabilities:} the ERTMS capabilities of the track
\item \emph{getAck:} Boolean input that signals the acknowledgment of the
  driver (from DMI)
\item \emph{resetIdle:} Boolean input to reset without acknowledge
\item \emph{currentDistance:} the current position of the train given with the
  same reference as the position of the level transition order (train position , from localisation)
\item \emph{ackDistance:} the maximal distance for driver acknowledge after
  the level transition (from paquet 41)
\item \emph{immediateAck:} a Boolean that signals that an immediate acknowledge
  is required
\item \emph{received L2 L3 MA:} a Boolean that indicates that a level 2 or level
  3 movement authority for the track behind the level transition has been
  received (from paquet 15)
\item \emph{received L1 MA:} a Boolean that indicates that a level 1 movement
  authority for the track behind the level transition has been received (from paquet 12)
\item \emph{received target speed:} a Boolean indicating that a target speed for
  the track behind the level transition has been received (from paquet 27) ?
\end{itemize}

and the following outputs:

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{next level:} the next level after this computation cycle
\item \emph{Trip train:} a Boolean indicating whether the train should be
  tripped
\item \emph{previous level:} the previous level before this computation cycle
\item \emph{needsAckFromDriver:} a Boolean that indicates whether an
  acknowledgment from the driver is necessary
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Functional Design Description}

On the most abstract level the design consists of the \emph{manage\_priorities} function which takes the level transition order priority tables as inputs and computes the highest priority transition.

This transition order is the fed to the \emph{computeLevelTransitions} operator. This operator consists of three main parts. The \emph{ComputeTransitionConditions} operator that emits the fulfilled conditions to change from a given level to a new level, the \emph{LevelStateMachine} that stores the current level and takes the computed change conditions as input for possible level transitions and finally the \emph{driverAck} operator which contains a state machine that stores the information whether the system is currently waiting for a driver acknowledge and emits the train trip information if necessary.
