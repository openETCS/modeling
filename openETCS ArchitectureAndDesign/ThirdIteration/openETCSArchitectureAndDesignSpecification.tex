\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}
The openETCS work package 3 (WP3) aims to provide – amongst others - the software architecture for the openETCS kernel in order to eventually build the software itself. WP3  partner has put great effort in the openETCS software design, thus far without making definite choices on the software architecture itself respective of functional breakdown and data structures of the openETCS kernel. Since the project planning foresees in the production of a reference software to be used as a demonstrator by June 2014, it is of paramount importance that a design freeze of the openETCS kernel architecture be finalized shortly but no later than November 2014.\\

In compliance with the agreements made during the last WP 3 meeting at the 10.09.2014 in Brussels, DB has taken the initiative to design the aforesaid architecture including of functional breakdown and data structures in order to safeguard a timely delivery of these products. Furthermore, DB has ensured that these developments are focused on including end user requirements so as to develop a design in conformity with the needs and requirements of the operators. Specialists of DB and NS have cooperated together with other partners in WP3 to produce this document.\\

As referred to above, the architecture description has to be finalized in the month of November 2014. This version of the document is a draft version, demonstrating the general directions and philosophy of the architectural design, the functional breakdown of the software and the data structures. The design is focused on maximum efficiency in order to maximize on RAMS performance of the end product.\\

\textbf{This document, named second iteration, is a draft document and will be developed until a complete architecture.}\\

Since this is a work in progress, any remarks referring to the improvement of the document, including reporting errors, are more than welcome. Any additional work done thus far on the subject by other WP3 partners will be incorporated in this document as long as it is aligned with and consistent or complementary  to the fundamental viewpoints advocated in this document after a review in respect to the openETCS process. At the same time, any contributions to the  integration of which will demand discussion or changes of the fundamentals as proposed in this document, will be discarded with . Only in this way the ITEA2 project is able to meet its objectives as mentioned above. There will be two workshops in which there is due time and opportunities to fine-tune this document and its contents. Any comments will be addressed there.\\

It is urgent to definitely finalize the architecture on a short notice and therefore this document will rather prescribe than describe the openETCS architecture, functional decomposition of the system and the data structures within the limits as stated above. The document is divided in two parts, i.e.:\\
•	A description of the general architecture of the openETCS OnBoard Kernel (software) including data structures prepared by NS….\\
•	A description of the functional decomposition of the openETCS OBU (software) in alignment with the general architecture prepared by DB…..\\


Furthermore, this document describes the preconditions on which said descriptions are based on, the status and planning of upcoming activities and the main objectives of DB and NS as the End User. Wherever necessary, reference will be made to documents that underline the agreements that have been made during the openETCS architecture design process and the activities and meetings of WP3. \\


\section{Objectives}

The prime objective of WP3 is to produce a rapid prototype for the openETCS reference system that can function as a demonstrator in collaboration with WP 4 and WP 5  for the openETCS approach and will be used as such in the final phase of the project. That phase is the first half of 2015.  This objective is defined as … 

\textbf{High level Objectives of this work:}\\
<<any further general statements on the ITEA2  objectives, like…>>\\
• Work on a model bases approach and process for effective collaborative work within an international ETCS developer team
as stated above, the project needs a definite architecture design by the end of 2014.  This document targets:\\
•	Defining the general design and conditions of the openETCS architecture, functional breakdown and data structures;\\
•	Providing the guidelines for discussion during the workshops that are planned in October and November 2014 that will result in the final and decisive version of this document;\\
•	Being the ‘platform’ for finalization i.e. whatever be the products or results of the workshops shall be integrated in this document. 
Apart from these general objectives, the document means to provide for the materials that will enable WP3 partners to improve the efficiency of the Work Package activities:\\
• The comprehensive architecture design shall enable splitting the work load according to the building blocks defined by the architecture and allocate strictly compartmented work parcels or activities to WP3 partners. \\
• Doing so will enable WP3 to avoid any double work\\
• Compartmenting the work load according to the functional building blocks as defined by the architecture will enable efficient planning of activities, be it individually or the integrated WP3 planning for the coming period, aiming at a just in time delivery of all results and products;\\
• Each partner that is responsible for one of the work parcels shall abide by the requirements in terms of quality and timeliness as defined by this document and prior documents and agreements made within the ITEA2 project.\\

\section{Roles, responsibilities and tasks}
In this section, the roles and responsibilities of the WP3 partners are confirmed, especially where they divert from what has been agreed upon at the start of WP3:\\
•	First of all, in the last WP 3 meeting in Brussels on  10.09.2014 DB proposed to take over the lead of the architecture design and functional breakdown. At the subsequent weekly scrum meeting on 12.09.2014,  it was agreed upon by all participants that DB will take over the lead (see Appendix … );\\
•\textbf{Planning:} Alstom as WP 3 leader will remain to be responsible for the planning and the allocation of the defined tasks to the different partners\\
•\textbf{Roles:} Alstom will also coordinate the work and safeguard that the defined results will be delivered according to the quality requirements that are agreed within the ITEA2 project and the schedule and the milestones that will be agreed upon during the coming workshops;\\
•All WP3 partners will deliver the results or products according to planning as will be agreed upon during the said workshops. \\

In the interest of a swift production of the critical documentation of which this version is a draft, specific tasks will be defined in terms of concrete results to be delivered, the timeframes in which these results must be produced and the partner who shall be responsible for that specific result and the planning. This is to safeguard the timely delivery. The process will be described in the next sections.\\

\section{Process}
\begin{itemize}
\item Alstom as WP 3 leader will be responsible for planning
\item Time and quality aspects should be respected
\item openETCS tools and methodology must be respected
\end{itemize}

Most of the operational requirements to WP3 in the last phases of the ITEA2 project have been described in the former paragraphs. This section will describe the process which has to lead to the final result: the reference software to be used in the demonstrator next year, more specifically the final description of the openETCS architecture including the data structures and its functional decomposition. The process will run as follows:\\
•	DB will supervise  the development of the first ‘firm’ draft of the specified products, ‘firm’ meaning that changes can only be made within the framework of these products and not to the fundamentals of these products as described in this document; \\
•	DB will supervise the preparation of the two workshops that are proposed by Alstom and aim at defining the final and definite architecture, data structures and functional decomposition. It will make proposals for a planning of the critical tasks that remain to be done;\\
•	Alstom will lead the two workshops following the preparations and the instructions of DB. Since all participants are intrinsically involved in the development work and tend to immerse themselves in technical discussions, for productivity purposes it is proposed to make use of a (non-technical) moderator that will be made responsible for coordinating the meeting, the discussions and the team efforts according ot the agenda.\\
•	Also for productivity reasons, introductory presentations will be restricted to the contents and setup of this document since all prior efforts have to be merged with this document and not the other way around. Following a general introduction into the work that has been so far, the other contributions will be scrutinized on their consistency with this document and any useful sections will be merged with this document.\\
•	During the workshops, there will be ample room reserved for enhancing this document, using other documents pertaining to the same field of work that have been delivered by other partners. Only material that is aligned with the general philosophy and structures proposed by this document, will be integrated;\\
•	In case conflicting views emerge over the benefits and value of certain contributions, at the very moment that parties conclude that they have conflicting views, these will be listed in an inventory for later discussion. The moderator shall note any such conflicts on the said inventory. Conflicting views will be treated at the end of each workshop whenever there is sufficient time or will be treated in a separate meeting that will be chaired by DB as coordinator of the ITEA2 project.\\
•	The workshop shall be attended by a secretary provided for by DB who is responsible for making the workshop minutes. Within a week after each workshop these minutes shall be distributed among the partners that have cooperated in the workshop and be reviewed by those. \\
•	The main objective of the workshops shall be the finalization of this document. In order to reach the specified result, the remaining tasks shall be identified and split into separate tasks or work parcels. Every task or work parcel will be allotted to one single responsible partner. Responsibility relates to the timely delivery of the defined result and according to quality requirements;\\
•	Alstom, as WP3 leader, will be responsible for the planning, allocation of tasks or work parcels to partners and will ensure timely delivery of results;\\
•	In case there will be tasks or work packages that cannot be finalized during the workshops or will be identified during the workshops and do not fit in the actual planning, these will be allotted in such a way that deadlines are perfectly clear and acknowledged by the party that is responsible for the results, fit within the general requirements of the project and are agreed upon in writing and executed by the responsible partners according to agreement;\\
•	DB as partner that has integral responsibility for both the ITEA2 project and responsible as well for the architecture etc. , is entitled to interfere take over the role as leader / coordinator in case the workshops prove to be insufficiently productive;\\
•	All output will be such, that it can be integrated in this document. It is the responsibility of DB to integrate the results and to deliver the final and definite version of this document. \\
•	The document concept will follow the openETCS process and tools (LaTex and Git-hub).\\

\section{Assumption and Preconditions}
\begin{itemize}
\item All future contributions shall be fully aligned an compliant the finalized and approved document 
\item Alls documents produced by the partners are requested to be compliant and merge to this document; other contributions will be discarded
\end{itemize}
The workshops are all about working as swift, as efficient and as productive as possible and make full use of the potential made available for these workshops by the partners. It is expected that the partners in the workshops will have the express intention to:\\
•	Contribute to the workshops with the intention to finalize the openETCS architecture;\\
•	Provide resources according to the agreements made prior to the Workshops;\\
•	Focus primarily on  getting concrete results regardless of methodological issues that might arise. Where necessary or opportune, classical project management methodology will be applied;\\
•	Provide full transparency with respect to experience, knowledge base and information touching the subjects to be treated in the workshops;\\
•	Document on paper or electronically all output of the workshops and integrate these with the underlying document;\\
•	Restrict discussions only to topics that have an immediate impact on the content or the quality of the end product: the improved version of this document.\\


\section{Functions ERTMS/ETCS}
The ERTMS / ETCS system was developed with a view to interoperability of trains on the 
different European rail networks. It is divided into "tracks" - and "board" finishes 
and shall establish a mutual message operation, by beacons or through a "radio" - 
The transmission system (in this case a mobile telephone network GSM-R) is performed. 
It defines several operating levels, and the system must also interfaces with the 
existing monitoring systems of the trains (using STM) have. 
The ERTMS / ETCS system provides the transport operator (the track) the choice of conditions 
concerning the use and operation. 
The train must therefore may go with different operating conditions on routes. 
Thus has the onboard equipment but must be implemented, 
to the interoperability of the train to ensure on the other networks. 
These functions must therefore correspond to one standard: the SRS (version 3.3.0). 

application functions, which have two different species of origin: 
defined in the SRS: here one finds in particular the 
speed monitoring- and transfer functions; these functions 
must be implemented in full accordance with the SRS; they can in 
indeed be on any network on which the train is used; these functions 
are described below in Section \ref{SRSFunction}; 


Moreover, there are functions to adapt to the train: so, for example, the processing 
a "separation distance" in the airborne equipment trigger: 
This is dependent on the distribution of functions between the 
Control monitoring equipment (which the ERTMS / ETCS), and the other 
CCS Systems.

\section{openETCS Architecture: History and Iterations}

The openETCS Architecture and Design is implemented in iterations \cite{deployment}. The current step (second iteration) is based on a step to implement the kernel functions of the ETCS system \cite{firstIteration}. For a better understanding of the scope the Iteration is described in the following.

\subsection{First Iteration Functional Scope: The Minimum OBU Kernel Function}
\label{sec:FunctionalScopeTheMinimumOBUKernelFunction}

The openETCS first iteration architecture and the design of the openETCS OBU software as mainly specified in \cite{subset-026} UNISIG Subset\_026 version\_3.3.0. 

The appropriate functionality has been divided into a list of functions of different complexity (see the WP3 function list \cite{functions}).

All these functions are object of the openETCS project and have to be analysed from their requirements and subsequently modelled and implemented. With limited manpower, a reasonable selection and order of these functions is required for the practical work that allows the distribution of the workload, more openETCS participants to join and leads to an executable---limited---kernel function as soon as possible. 

While the first version of this document focuses on the first version of the limited kernel function, it is intended to grow in parallel to the growing openETCS software.

The first objective of the first iteration was
\begin{itemize}
	\item ``Make the train run as soon as possible, with a very minimum functionality, and in the form of a rapid prototype.''
\end{itemize}
This does not contradict the openETCS goal to conform to EN50128.
\begin{itemize}
	\item After a phase of prototyping, the openETCS software shall be implemented in compliance to EN50128 for SIL4 systems.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{How to find the functions of the First Iteration in the Architecture}
The functions will be merged with the new architecture. Wherever a function has already been in the scope it will be marked as "first iteration".

\subsection{Reference abstract hardware architecture}
Authors: David Mentre (MERCE), Bernd Hekele (DB)

\subsubsection{Why a reference abstract hardware architecture?}

For proper understanding of openETCS API and of constraints imposed on
both sides of the API, we need to define a \define{reference abstract hardware architecture}. This hardware architecture is ``abstract''
is the sense that the actual vendor specific hardware architecture
might be totally different of the abstract architecture described in
this chapter. For example, several units might be grouped together on
the same processor.

However the actual vendor specific architecture shall fulfil all the
requirements and constraints of this reference abstract hardware
architecture and shall not request additional constraints.

\subsubsection{Definition of the reference abstract hardware architecture}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{abstract-hardware-architecture.pdf}
  \caption{Reference abstract hardware architecture}
  \label{fig:hardware-arch}
\end{figure}

The reference abstract hardware architecture is shown in figure
\ref{fig:hardware-arch}.

The reference abstract hardware architecture is made of a bus on which
are connected \define{units}:
\begin{itemize}
\item EVC (European Vital Computer);
\item TIU (Train Interface Unit);
\item ODO (Odometry);
\item DMI (Driver Machine Interface);
\item STM (Specific Transmission Module, up to 8 units): Not part of this openETCS implementation;
\item BTM (Balise Transmission Module);
\item LTM (Loop Transmission Module): Not part of this openETCS implementation;
\item EURORADIO;
\item JRU (Juridical Recording Unit): Not part of this openETCS implementation;
\end{itemize}

Elements not being part of this implementation are marked. 

Those units shall working concurrently. They shall exchange
information with other units through asynchronous message passing.

\subsubsection{Reference abstract software architecture}
\label{software-arch}

\subsubsection{Overall architecture}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{software-architecture.pdf}
  \caption{Reference abstract software architecture}
  \label{fig:software-arch}
\end{figure}

The \define{reference abstract software architecture} is shown in figure
\ref{fig:software-arch}. This architecture is made of following
elements:
\begin{itemize}
\item \define{openETCS executable model} produced by the
  \cite{scade-model}. It shall contain the program implementing core
  ETCS functions;
\item\define{openETCS model run-time system} shall help the execution
  of the openETCS executable model by providing additional functions
  like encode/decode messages, proper execution of the model through
  appropriate scheduling, re-order or prioritize messages, etc. 
\item \define{Vendor specific API adapter} shall make the link between
  the Vendor specific platform and the openETCS model run-time system.
  It can buffer message parts, encode/decode messages, route messages
  to other EVC components, etc.
\item All above three elements shall be included in the EVC;
\item \define{Vendor specific platform} shall be all other elements of
  the system, bus and other units, as shown in figure
  \ref{fig:hardware-arch}.
\end{itemize}

We have thus three interfaces:
\begin{itemize}
\item \define{model interface}
 is the interface between openETCS
  executable model and openETCS model run-time system. 
\item \define{openETCS API}
 is the interface between openETCS model
  run-time system and Vendor specific API adapter.
\item \define{Vendor specific API}
 is the interface between Vendor
  specific API adapter and Vendor specific platform. This interface is
  not publicly described for all vendors. You can find the Alstom imnplementation as an example.
\end{itemize}

The two blocks openETCS executable model and openETCS model run-time
system are making the \define{Application software} part. This Application software might be either openETCS reference software or
vendor specific software.

The Vendor specific API adapter is making the \define{Basic software} part.

\subsection{F1.1: openETCS API Runtime System and Input)}
Authors: Bernd Hekele (DB)

\subsubsection{Principles for Interfaces (openETCS API)}

Information  is exchanged \define{messages} in an asynchronous way. A message is a set
of information corresponding to an event of a particular unit, e.g. a
balise received from the BTM. The possible kind of messages are
described in chapter \ref{information-flows}.

The information is passed to the executable model as parmeters to the snychronous call of a procedure (Interface to the executable model). Since the availability of input messages to the application is not guaranteed the parts of the interfaces are defined with a "present" flag. In addition, fields of input arraysquite often is of variable size. Implementation in the concrete interface in this use-case is the use of a "size" parameter and a "valid"-flag.


\subsubsection{openETCS Model Runtime System}
The openETCS model runtime system also provides:

\begin{itemize}
\item Input Functions From other Units\\
In this entity messages from other connected units are received.
\item Output Functions to other Units\\
The entity writes messages to other connected units.
\item Conversation Functions for Messages (Bitwalker)\\
The conversion function are triggered by Input and Ouput Functions. The main task is to convert input messages from an bit-packed format into logical ETCS messages (the ETCS language) and Output messages from Logical into a bit-packed format. The logical format of the messages is defined for all used types in the openETCS data dictonary. \\
Variable size elements in the Messages are converted to fixed length arrays with an used elements indicator.\\
Optional elements are indicated with an valid flag.
The conversion routines are responsible for checking the data received is valid. If  faults are detected the information is passed to the openETCS executable model for further reaction. 
\item Model Cycle\\
The executable model is called in cycles. In the cycle 
\begin{itemize}
\item First the received input messages are decoded
\item The input data is passed to the executable model in a predefined order. \textbf{(Details for the interface to be defined)}.
\item Output is encoded according to the SRS and passed to the  buffers to the units.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Input Interfaces of the openETCS API}

\subsection{F1.2: openETCS API Output Functions)}


\subsection{Receive msg´s/ check consistency}
- version management (should be part of the bitwalker)\\

- management of multiple received balises (should be part of the bitwalker)\\
- build BG-messages\\
- Determine passing direction\\
- Store passing direction if received from RBC\\
- Store radio messages\\
- check linking consistency and delete detected and missed BG's from announced BG's\\
- check BG-message consistency\\
- check Radio-message consistency\\
- Retrieve individual packets (for delivery to filtering)\\

\subsection{Build coordinate system and calculate train position}
- Update the coordinate system when a new BG is detected (taking into account detected “balise 1” from not completed BG's), i.e. backward -   - Calculation of position of passed BG's.\\
- Management of multiple detected BG's\\
- Relate the (location based) information in received messages to the reference system\\
- Update train position at LRBG\\
- Update the train position with the distance driven since last update (or reset to LRBG position)\\

\subsection{Store inputs from the TIU}

\subsection{Store inputs from the DMI}
- Store received acknowledgement and inputs in the “DMI request buffer” (includes “data-entry”)\\

\subsection{Filtering (Mode/Level) - One packet per type}
\textbf{ISSUE: HOW MANY PKT 44, 65 AND 66 PER MESSAGE ARE MAXIMALLY SUPPORTED?}\\
- Check on announced and immediate level transition orders in the messages to be filtered (needed for further criteria for filtering, to decide if the data shall be stored in the transition buffer).\\
- Filter data stored in the transition buffer according to the current level (what to do if similar information is available in the new message??). Data can be rejected, accepted or kept in the transition buffer.
(Filtering according to new level will be done directly afterwards in the next cycle)\\
- Filter new received messages according to the current level (new level will be done in the next cycle as according to SRS data first has to be filtered according to old level and afterwards to new level). Data can be rejected, accepted or stored in the transition buffer.\\
- Filter (level) accepted data according to originating RBC (supervising or other). Information from BG's, loops or RIU is not filtered with this filter.\\
- Filter (level and RBC) accepted data according to the current mode (only reject or accept)\\

\subsection{Store data (direct orders, BG lists, NV, track data, procedure parameters, confirmations)}
- Store direct and conditional orders\\
- Store BG lists for SH and SR\\

- If new national values are announced, then those can lead to more restrictive braking curves. Therefore a speed restriction has to be calculated for the location where the values become valid, based on the targets in advance of this point. \\

\subsection{Build and update MRSP and list of targets at LRBG}
- Overlay speed restrictions (one by one) over the resulting SSP as received from “build location based data”.\\
- Close the resulting profile with the “end of authority” or “limit of authority” as delivered by “MA-management” resulting in the MRSP at the LRBG.
(in on-sight or limited supervision mode, those may not be available)\\
- Select list of “speed reductions”\\
- Evaluate (backwards) which targets are relevant, resulting in the list of most restrictive targets at the LRBG.\\
- Relocate targets (beyond this location) to the “minimum border crossing location”, i.e. the minimum safe location where National values are changed, and add the minimum resulting speed at this location to the list of targets.\\
- Reasoning:  new national values might cause more conservative braking curves which otherwise could lead to an intervention at the border.\\

\subsection{Profile supervision, i.e. BCM and ceiling speed supervision (active for FS, OS and LS)}
- Update MRSP for distance driven, i.e. lower the distance to all speed decreases with the maximum distance driven since last update, lower the distance to all speed increases with the minimum distance driven since last update, reorder the distances in the list if locations to lower and to increase changed order.\\
- Determine the local maximum speed\\
- Update the list of targets, i.e. lower the distance to all targets with the maximum distance driven since last update (order will not change) and select the current most restrictive target (always the first in the list)\\
- braking curve monitoring; calculate the braking curves to the most restrictive target, taking into account gradients\\
- ceiling speed supervision; monitor against the local maximum speed.\\

\subsubsection{Movement supervision}
- Roll away protection\\

\subsubsection{Area Supervision}
In shunting, post trip, reversing and staff responsible an area (plus in some cases ceiling speed) is protected. In unfitted only a speed. The way the area is protected differs per mode therefore a function shall be available for each mode:\\
- area supervision in shunting (taking into account a list of BG's to be passed)\\
- area supervision in staff responsible (taking into account a list of BG's to be passed and/or a distance)\\
- reversing area supervision\\
- post trip supervision (only reverse movement).\\

\subsubsection{Update procedure status (including commanding actions towards driver, radio or RBC)}
- SoM:\\ 
- EoM\\
- Enter shunting by driver or track side command
override\\
- Enter “on sight”\\ 
- Enter “staff responsible”\\
- level transitions\\
- Manage train trip\\
- Exit shunting\\
- Passive shunting\\
- Change train orientation\\
- Splitting/combining\\
- Stopping in rear of LX level crossing\\
- Changing train data (not by the driver)\\
- Handling track conditions (including indications):  not applicable for Amsterdam-Utrecht\\
- Limited supervision entry:  not applicable for Amsterdam-Utrecht\\
- release brakes (after trip)\\
- handle track ahead free request\\

\subsubsection{Mode/Level management}
- Manage all conditions for level changes except the direct transitions (handled in filtering): F41\\
- Manage all conditions for mode changes (except msg 16 if that leads to a mode change): F42\\

\subsubsection{DMI management}
