The task of block ``Train Supervision'' is to monitor the speed of the train and the train location and as such to ensure that the speed remains within the given speed and distance limits. This block is mainly based on \cite[Chapt.~3.13]{subset-026}.

The block ``Train Supervision'' takes as input (1) movement related information such as train speed, train position and acceleration, (2) train related information such as brake information and train length, and (3) track related information such as speed and distance limits and national values.

Based on this information a list of targets is calculated and, for each such target, the speed the train should have. Braking curves calculate at which location at the track the train has to accelerate and to perform the brake, respectively. These calculations lead to commands being sent to the driver and the brake system.

The functionality is modeled using four operators, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ssv}, which are explained below.

The current status of the analysis of ``Train Supervision'' and a functional breakdown can be found in a separate document, \verb+SpeedSupervision_analysis.pdf+.



\subsubsection{Input}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \cite[Chapt.~3.13]{subset-026}: Speed and distance monitoring 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Short description of the functionality}
The motivation for this operator is to convert all inputs of block ``Speed Supervision'' that contain information about length, speed, distance, and acceleration defined as integer into real to allow for highest precision in the calculations. In addition, to ease the modeling, inside block ``Speed Supervision'' only units meters, seconds, and meters per square second are used.

\paragraph{Functional Design Description}
This operator forwards input messages, takes data from complex data types or transforms inputs messages into an internal type thereby converting int to real.

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Short description of the functionality}
This operator calculates/updates the list of targets to be supervised by the block ``Train Supervision''. Taking the current movement authority and the most restrictive speed profile as an input, the operator outputs a list of locations corresponding to the most restrictive speed profile, a list of locations corresponding to a limit of authority, the location of an end of authority, or the location of supervised location.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \cite[Chapt.~3.13.10]{subset-026}: Speed and distance monitoring commands 
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Short description of the functionality}
This operator models the speed and distance monitoring commands. More precisely, it triggers the service or emergency brake and outputs the current supervision status of the OBU together with information on speeds and locations to the driver.
\paragraph{Interface}
\paragraph{Functional Design Description}
The OBU can be in any of three types of speed and distance monitoring modes: ceiling speed monitoring, release speed monitoring and target speed monitoring. We use a state machine to model the switching between the three modes: each state models a mode and a transition between to states is enabled if the condition two switch between the two corresponding modes is evaluated to true. In each mode, the OBU can be in up to five different supervision stati. The behavior of changing from one status to another is also modeled as a state machine. As a result, the model is a hierarchical state machine.

\paragraph{Reference to the SRS or other Requirements (or other requirements)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \cite[Chapt.~3.13]{subset-026}: Speed and distance monitoring 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Short description of the functionality}
This operator is the counterpart to operator SDM\_OutputWrapper---that is, it converts all internal outputs of block ``Speed Supervision'' that contain information about length, speed, distance, and acceleration defined as real into int, such that all other blocks can stick to their types and also performs the calculation into units used by the environment.

\paragraph{Interface}

\paragraph{Functional Design Description}
This operator forwards input messages and transforms inputs messages into an internal type thereby converting real to int.
