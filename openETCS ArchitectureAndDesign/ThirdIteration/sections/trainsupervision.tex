The task of block ``Train Supervision'' is to monitor the speed of the train and the train location and as such to ensure that the speed remains within the given speed and distance limits. This block is mainly based on \cite[Chapt.~3.13]{subset-026}.

The block ``Train Supervision'' takes as input (1) movement related information such as train speed, train position and acceleration, (2) train related information such as brake information and train length, and (3) track related information such as speed and distance limits and national values.

Based on this information a speed profile is calculated. Speed restrictions create target speeds (targets) that have to be followed. For each such target braking curves are generated to supervise at which location of the track the train must perform the brake. In case of no target restrictions the train may accelerate to the supervised maximum speed of the speed profile. These calculations lead to commands being sent to the driver and the brake system.

The functionality is modeled using four operators, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ssv}, which are explained below.

The current status of the analysis of ``Train Supervision'' and a functional breakdown can be found in a separate document, \verb+SpeedSupervision_analysis.pdf+.



\subsubsection{Input}
For providing the output, the module needs different input data flows. Table \ref{tbl:speedsupervisionInput} gives an overview.

\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Short description of the functionality}
The motivation for this operator is to convert all inputs of block ``Speed Supervision'' that contain information about length, speed, distance, and acceleration defined as integer into \texttt{real} to allow automatically the highest precision in the calculations by the meaning of floating point operations. In addition, to ease the modeling, inside block ``Speed Supervision'' only units meters ($[m]$), seconds($[s]$), meters per second($[\frac{m}{s}]$), and meters per square second($[\frac{m}{s^{2}}]$) are used.

\paragraph{Functional Design Description}
This operator forwards input messages, takes data from complex data types or transforms inputs messages into an internal type thereby converting int to real.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \cite[Chapt.~3.13.8.2]{subset-026}: Determination of the supervised targets 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Short description of the functionality}
This operator calculates/updates the list of targets to be supervised by the block ``Train Supervision''. Taking the current movement authority and the most restrictive speed profile as an input, the operator outputs a list of locations corresponding to the most restrictive speed profile, a list of locations corresponding to a limit of authority, the location of an end of authority, or the location of supervised location.

The operator takes as Inputs the Movement Authority, Most Restrictive Speed Profile and the current maximum safe front end position. 

The Output is a single End of Authority Target, a list of all MRSP-Targets and a list of all LoA-Targets.
  
\paragraph{Interface}

\paragraph{Functional Design Description}
\subparagraph{Derivation of Targets from Movement Authority Sections}
The sections of the \emph{Movement Authority} could cause 2 types of Targets:
\begin{itemize}
\item End Of Authority(EoA) - only one could exist and this is only in the \emph{end section} of the \emph{MA}
\item Limit of Authority (LoA) - is possibly in every section of the \emph{MA} except the end section
\end{itemize}
In every Cycle the MA is updated, the operator iterates over the whole MA and put all speed limitations by \emph{LoA}s into a list of targets. The end section is used to derived the \emph{EoA}-Target. All LoA targets are sorted by location.

\subparagraph{Derivation of Targets from MRSP}
As the \cite[Chapt.~3.13.8.2]{subset-026} says, every speed decrease of the MRSP is used to derive a target. Therefore in every cycle the MRSP is updated, the whole MRSP is iterated to search for all MRSP Targets. For this purpose, every element of the MRSP is compared with its successor. When the calculation arrives the last valid element, the calculation is exited.

\subparagraph{Updating of Targets}
In every cycle the operator monitors all targets, whether they are already passed by iterating over the list of targets comparing the current max safe front end position with the target position.

	%
	\item \cite[Chapt.~3.13.8.5]{subset-026}: Guidance curves (GUI)
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Short description of the functionality}
For each type of target a certain braking curve has to be calculated. This curve enables us, to proactively monitor the speed of the train. From this braking curve could be derived, where the train has to start braking for a given actual speed. The braking curve is not depended on actual train status, as a consequence the braking curve stay constant over a certain time. Only to stop the calculation of the braking curve the estimated front end position is used, but this is only to have an always valid exit condition.
\paragraph{Interface}
\paragraph{Functional Design Description}
The braking curve calculation takes the complex input function $A_{safe}$, which describes the overall braking performance of the train in a speed and position depended meaning. This two dimensional function needs to be simplified for every target to get an function of position to speed. The individual target has a position and a speed (a point in the distance speed plain) and is the starting point of the braking curve. The initial step is to getting the deceleration of the train at the target point from the $A_{safe}$-function. Afterwards the calculation iterates through the $A_{safe}$-function until the current estimated front end position is reached. While this two cases could appear:

\begin{itemize}
\item a new distance step of $A_{safe}$ is reached
\item a new speed step of $A_{safe}$ is reached
\end{itemize}

Both cases are checked and the applicable one is used to calculate a new Arc. Every Arc of the braking curve consists of:
\begin{itemize}
\item distance where the arc begins
\item speed at the point, where the arc begins
\item deceleration for the whole arc
\end{itemize}
An abstract overview of the calculation could be seen in picture \ref{fig:bc_calc}.

Currently, the model supports the calculation of the following braking curves:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the Emergency Brake Deceleration curve for the most restrictive speed profile,
	%
	\item the Emergency Brake Deceleration curve for the limit of authority,
	%
	\item the Emergency Brake Deceleration curve for the end of authority, and
	%
	%\item the Service Brake Deceleration curve for the end of authority

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Short description of the functionality}
This operator calculates the various locations needed to determine the speed and distance monitoring commands. The current implementation of functionality is stateless and requires a complete recalculation each cycle.

\paragraph{Interface}
\subparagraph{Input}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \texttt{MRSPProfile} Speed profile related to current track under train.
  \item \texttt{odometry}, \texttt{trainLocations} External state of train provided by odometry.
  \item \texttt{targetCollection} The different target (list) types wrapped in a structure.
  \item \texttt{curveCollection} The related braking curves correlated to above targets.
  \item \texttt{$v_{release}$} Release speed as defined by external sources.
  \item \texttt{$v_{ura}$} Speed under reading amount.
  \item \texttt{inhibitUnderReadingCompensation} A flag defined by National Value, relating to above item.
  \item \texttt{$T_{bs}$, $T_{be}$, $T_{tractionCutOff}$} Time constants defined externally or in other modules.
\end{enumerate}
\subparagraph{Output}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \texttt{locations} Internal type to wrap the locations calculated herein and pass it on directly to SDM-Commands-Operator.
  \item \texttt{MostRestrictiveTarget} An internal structure to contain the information the target based locations are linked to.
  \item \texttt{FLOIisSBI1} Flag is true if First Line of Intervention uses the service brake curve (SBI1) or false if it uses deceleration values based on the emergency brake curve (SBI2).
  \item \texttt{$v_{target}$} The designated speed of the Most Restrictive Target. This is a convienience reference into the above data structure. 
  \item \texttt{$v_{MRSP}$} The current Most Restrictive Speed at the Max Save Frontend of the train.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Functional Design Description}
This operator gathers all necessary input values and computes some frequently used intermediate values in the suboperators \texttt{surplusTractionDeltas} and \texttt{$v_{bec}$}. The other input prepartion operator is the \texttt{TargetSelector} whose main task is to dissect the list of targets to find the Most Restrictive Target. The accompanying braking curves are extracted and promoted to trailing location calculations. Also the special values of the EOA are exposed.

The other half of the operator creates the requested values for the commands package. These ar in particular the preindication locations for EBD and SBD based targets, the release speed monitoring start locations, the locations for target speed monitoring of the I-, W-, P- and FLOI-curve, the related FLOI speed and the location of the permitted speed supervision limit. Included in the output are also certain flags for the validity of linked values.

\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Short description of the functionality}
This operator models the speed and distance monitoring commands. More precisely, it triggers the service or emergency brake and outputs the current supervision status of the OBU together with information on speeds and locations to the driver.
\paragraph{Interface}
\paragraph{Functional Design Description}
The OBU can be in any of three types of speed and distance monitoring modes: ceiling speed monitoring, release speed monitoring and target speed monitoring. We use a state machine to model the switching between the three modes: each state models a mode and a transition between to states is enabled if the condition two switch between the two corresponding modes is evaluated to true. In each mode, the OBU can be in up to five different supervision stati. The behavior of changing from one status to another is also modeled as a state machine. As a result, the model is a hierarchical state machine.
