Description				& This function is in charge of the computation of new mode to apply according to conditions from inputs (track information, driver interactions, train data,...) and other functions.

Three subfunctions are defined:
\begin{description}
\item[Inputs] proceeds to inputs check and preparation.
\item[ComputeModesCondition] performs all specific procedure linked to mode management and defined in  \citep{subset-026} sections 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8, 5.9, 5.11, 5.12, 5.13, 5.19 and specifies the conditions to define a mode transition according condition table of section 4.6.3 of \citep{subset-026}
\item[SwitchModes] performs the mode selection according the conditions and priorities defined in transition table  section 4.6.2 of \citep{subset-026}
\item[Outputs] prepares packet of outputs.
