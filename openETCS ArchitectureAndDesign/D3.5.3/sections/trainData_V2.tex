Description				& Implementation of the train data with the corresponding interfaces to track, driver and RBC.

This component provides the storage of train data and the procedures necessary for updating data and controlling interfaces for validating train data at the DMI and to the RBC. 

The scope of train data is defined in Section 3.18.3 of the SRS. Train data are qualifying some safety relevant properties of the train like the length of the train, maximal speed and brake behaviour. 

During startup of the EVC a first definition of the train data is received from the train interface unit (TIU). During Start of Mission the data is updated respectively validated by the driver via the Driver Machine Interface (DMI).  The driver may also change some of the data and has to confirm the set of data before being able to push the start button.
 
When setting up a radio session to an RBC the EVC has to send the actual train data to the RBC for validation. here, the message flow is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item sending Message 129 (Validated Train Data)
\item receiving Message 8 (Acknowledment of Train Data) is processed as apart of the validation procedure with the RBC.
\item sending Message 146 (Acknolwedement) in the context of this message flow. T\_TRAIN parameter of the messages is used to confirm the association of the messages.
\end{itemize}

The trainData component uses a dedicated state for controlling the reception of the acknowledgement.\\
