Description				& The task of SDM is to monitor the speed of the train and the train location and as such to ensure that the speed remains within the given speed and distance limits. This block is based on \cite[Chapt.~3.13]{subset-026}.

The integration node ``SpeedSupervision\_Integration'' takes as input (1) movement related information such as train speed, train position and acceleration, (2) train related information such as brake information and train length, and (3) track related information such as speed and distance limits and national values.

Based on this information a speed profile is calculated. Speed restrictions create target speeds (targets) that have to be followed. For each such target braking curves are generated to supervise at which location of the track the train must apply the brake. In case of no target restrictions the train may accelerate to the supervised maximum speed of the speed profile. These calculations lead to commands being sent to the driver and the brake system.

The functionality is modeled using eight subcomponents, as shown in Figure~\ref{f:ssv}, which are explained in Section~\ref{s:SDM_subcomponents}.

The current status of the analysis of ``SDM'' and a functional breakdown can be found in a separate document, \verb+SpeedSupervision_analysis.pdf+.\\

\midrule
Source					& TrackAtlas; current release, hard wired constant: cP3NationalValuesUtrechtAmsterdam \\
\midrule
Type					& P3\_NationalValues\_T \\
\midrule
Valid range of values	& P3\_NationalValues\_T is a complex data type, valid ranges are specified in SRS Subset-026-7, no further checks are done here. \\
\midrule
Behaviour when value is at boundary	& n/a \\
\midrule
Behaviour for values out of valid range	& n/a \\
\midrule
Behaviour when value is erroneous, absent or unwanted (i.e. spurious) & Not checked; node must not be called without reasonable National Value. \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}


\paragraph{Train Position}

\begin{longtable}{p{.25\textwidth}p{.7\textwidth}}
\toprule
Input name				& TrainPosition \\
\midrule
Description				& This input is the current train position. \\

Type					& trainPosition\_T \\
\midrule
Valid range of values	& trainPosition\_T is a complex data type. Value valid must not be false for proper function and it may not be properly checked in current release. Furthermore, reversing (decreasing positions, reverse flag set) is currently NOT supported and leads to undefined behaviour. No brake will be thrown in this occasion.

\midrule
Behaviour for values out of valid range	& Currently not checked. \\
\midrule
Behaviour when value is erroneous, absent or unwanted (i.e. spurious) & Not checked; node must not be called without reasonable position data. Valid flag is not checked (bug), as SDM has not yet implemented exception handling on inacceptable input data. \\
