Description				& The component filters an input message in order to mark all elements as invalid, which are not designated for the current driving direction of the train.
\\
&
\begin{itemize}
 \item The operator contains two processing paths for different message types. Radio messages and balise group messages are handeled in a different way. For validating the data direction of a radio message, the check is performed using the balise group referenced in the radio message header as relevant balise group. For balise group message, the LRBG is used.
 \item The metadata of packets, which are recognized as not valid for the current driving direction, is invalidated.
