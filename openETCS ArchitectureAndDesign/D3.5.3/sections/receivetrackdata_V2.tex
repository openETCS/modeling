Description				& The functional block ``Manage\_TrackSideInformation\_Integration'' is responsible for receiving Eurobalise telegrams and Euroradio messages from the API and performs several consistency checks on the inputs.

The block collects the telegrams of balises in order to build balise group messages. Euroradio messages are always delivered as a whole message. On each message, a consistency check is performed, before the data is validated according to the driving direction of the train. In general, messages not designated for the current driving direction of the train are not forwarded for further processing. After applying consistency checks, the data direction is validated. Finally, the received message is handled in the InformationFilter subcomponent. The InformationFilter may, depending on level, mode and announced level transitions and radio handover scenarios, let information pass immediately, reject information, or buffer information for some cycles until certain conditions apply and the information will be passed. Information in this sense is packets in the context of messages.\\
\midrule
Input documents			& See subcomponents.\\
\midrule
Safety integrity level	& 4 \\
\midrule
Time constraints		& The component has to be able to receive balise telegrams and radio messages according to the ETCS performance requirements, c.f. \cite{subset-41}. In highspeed traffic, a group of 8 balises must be read in about 250 msec. In addition, 1 message per sec. on the radio interface is to be expected.\\
\midrule
API requirements 		& Interfaces to this unit are defined in the API sections [BTM], [EURORADIO], [ODO]. In these sections, also a detailed definition of the concepts implemented on those interfaces is documented.

\toprule
Input name				& API\_trackSide\_Message \\
\midrule
Description				& Track side message received from the API. The API performs preprocessing of RTM and BTM messages and delivers a maximum of a single message per cycle. The structure of this message is defined in the API [BTM] and [EURORADIO] sections. The input consists of the following main components:\\
&
\begin{description}
\item[valid](bool) Indicates the information has been refreshed in the cycle.
\begin{description}
\item[true]: Information is updated in this cycle.
\item[false]: Information is unchanged.
\end{description}
\end{description}\\
&
\begin{description}
\item[systemTimeMsgReceived](Obu\_BasicTypes\_Pkg::T\_internal\_Type): Timestamp when the system (i.e. the train) has received the message. The parameter is set either by RTM or by BTM modules.
\end{description}\\
&
\begin{description}
\item[msg\_type](Common\_Types\_Pkg::MsgSource\_T) source of this information. 
\begin{description}
\item[msrc\_undefined] indicates the information is not defined. This input is expected when valid flag is false.
\item[msrc\_Euroradio] indicates the information is a euroradio message.
\item[msrc\_Eurobalise] indicates the information is a balise telegram.
\end{description}
Other values of this enumeration are not expected in this model.
\end{description}\\
&
\begin{description}
\item[btm\_msg](API\_Msg\_Pkg::API\_TelegramHeader\_T) Telegram header with some additional information provided by the btm-module. The header is structured as follows:
\begin{description}
\item[present](bool) Telegram information has been received via BTM and the information of this telegram is present. 
\item[checkResult](bool) The telegram is checked after reception at the BTM. Typical checks are checksum-tests or checks at conversion of the types from bit-layout to the presentation in the evc. If checkResult is false the information may not be used. The information is evaluated in the checkBGConsistency component of this model.
\item[api\_bad\_balise\_received](bool) The telegram reception was disturbed. Again, the information related to this telegram may not be used in the EVC.
\item[api\_header](API\_Msg\_Pkg::API\_TelegramHeader\_T) Header of the telegram similar to Subset 026, Section 8.4.2.1. The information in the telegram is not packed on bit-boundaries.

\begin{description}
\item[present](bool) Radio message has been received via rtm and the information of this message is present. 
\item[apiConsistencyError](bool) The message is checked after reception at the btm. Typical checks are checksum-tests or checks at conversion of the types from bit-layout to the presentation in the evc. If apiConsistencyError is false the information may not be used. The information is evaluated in the checkRadioMessage component of this model.
\item[Radio\_Common\_Header](Radio\_Types\_Pkg::\newline Radio\_TrackTrain\_Header\_T) Header of the radio-message as defined in Subset-026, Section 8.4.4.6.1. In the SRS, depending on the concrete message, some optional variables are defined. In our implementation all optional variables are foreseen. In order to indicate the availability of variables the component radioMetadata is used (see below).
\item[radioMetadata](Common\_Types\_Pkg::RadioMetadata\_T) Metadata for optional variables in the common radio message header. For each optional component a presence indicator of type bool is in the list.  
\item[sendingRBC\_Id](Common\_Types\_Pkg::RBC\_Id\_T) Identifies the RBC as it is known at the RTM. Information is added to the interface in the RTM.
\begin{description}
\item[packets](Common\_Types\_Pkg::CompressedPackets\_T) Packets as received as a part of the telegram or radio message. The structure is set-up and can be accessed by library routines of the trackMessages component of the system. In the manage\_trackside\_Messages component packets may be changed to being absent (e.g., by the function validateDataDirection or by the InformationFilter.). If packets have to be treated only this valid indicator is changed. No other parts of the packets are accessed.

\toprule
Output name				& forLevelManagement \\
\midrule
Description				& The InformationFilter subcomponent has to provide information to the EVC components according to the actual level and radio state. In order to trigger the level change level management needs to know about avaialblity of track profiles and other components in order to select the correct mode and level. This output provides information relevant to trigger level transitions. The data will be accumulated in the InformationFilter until the position for the level change has been reached. The output structure consists of the following components:
\begin{description}
\item[P41](Packet\_Types\_Pkg::P41\_LevelTransistionOrders\_T) Packet 41 (level transition order). 
\item[P46](Packet\_Types\_Pkg::P46\_LevelTransistionOrders\_T) Packet 46 (conditional level transition order). 
\item[LRBG](NID\_LRBG) Reference LRBG for the level transition order..
\item[referenceLocation](Obu\_BasicTypes\_Pkg::L\_internal\_Type) Location of the reference LRBG. This location has to be used as reference for calculating the level transition position. 
\item[P12\_received](bool) Packet 12 (Level 1 Movement Authority) has been received at the InfomationFilter subcomponent in the context of this level transition. 
\item[P15\_received](bool) Packet 15 (Level 2/3 Movement Authority) has been received at the InfomationFilter subcomponent in the context of this level transition. 
\item[P21\_received](bool) Packet 21 Gradient Profile) has been received at the InfomationFilter subcomponent in the context of this level transition. 
\item[P27\_received](bool) Packet 27 (International Static Speed Profile) has been received at the InfomationFilter subcomponent in the context of this level transition.

\begin{longtable}{p{.25\textwidth}p{.7\textwidth}}
\toprule
Output name				& outputMessageForRadioAck \\
\midrule
Description				& Even if an imcoming radio message is rejected or kept for some time in the buffer of the InformationFilter subcomponent, some information needs to be made available for maintaining the communication session with the RBC, e.g., the timestamp of the received message and acknowledgment of message reception based on the ACK flag. No other information of this message is to be used in the EVC. This concept might be improved when radio management functions are rearranged.
