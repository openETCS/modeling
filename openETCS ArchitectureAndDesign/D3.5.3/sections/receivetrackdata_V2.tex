Description				& The block ``Manage\_TrackSideInformation\_Integration'' is responsible for receiving Eurobalise telegrams and Euroradio messages from the API and performs several consistency checks on the inputs.\newline

The block collects the telegrams of balises in order to build balise group messages. Euroradio messages are always delivered as a whole message. On each message, a consistency check is performed, before the data is validated according to the driving direction of the train. In general, messages not designated for the current driving direction of the train are not forwarded to the further processing. After applying consistency checks, the data direction is validated. Finally, the received message is handled in the information filter. The information filter may, depending on level, mode and announced level transitions and radio handover scenarios, let information pass immediately, store information for a later transfer or reject information.

Information in this sense is packets in the context of messages.\\

\midrule
Input documents			& See subcomponents.\\
\midrule
Safety integrity level	& 4 \\
\midrule
Time constraints		& The component has to be able to receive balise telegrams and radio messages according to the ETCS \cite{subset-41} performance requirements). In highspeed traffic, a group of 8 balises must be read in about 250 msec. In addition, 1 message per sec. on the radio interface is to be expected.\\
\midrule
API requirements 		& Interfaces to this unit are defined in the API sections [BTM], [EURORADIO], [ODO].In these sections, also a detailed definition of the concepts implemented on those interfaces is documented.  \\

\subsection{Interface}

An overview of the interface of component Manage\_TrackSideInformation\_Integration is shown in Figure~\ref{f:receiveAndCheckConsistencyArch}. The inputs and outputs are described in detail in Section~\ref{s:Manage_Trackside_inputs} respectively \ref{s:Manage_Trackside_outputs}. Subcomponents are described in Section~\ref{s:receivetrackdata_subcomponents}.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{s:Manage_Trackside_inputs}

\paragraph{fullChecks}

\begin{longtable}{p{.25\textwidth}p{.7\textwidth}}
\toprule
Input name				& fullChecks \\
\midrule
Description				& Indicates, if all checks on the message should be performed. This parameter is for testing purposes only and has to be replaced by a constant in real operation.\\
\midrule
Source					& This item is only relevant in verification phases. In a real system checks are always activated. \\ 
\midrule
Type					& bool \\
\midrule
Valid range of values	& 
\begin{description}
\item[true] All checks are performed.
\item[false] Component InformationFilter is deactivated.
\end{description} \\

\midrule
Behaviour for values out of valid range	& n/a \\
\midrule
Behaviour when value is erroneous, absent or unwanted (i.e. spurious) & n/a\\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}


\paragraph{API\_trackSide\_Message}

\begin{longtable}{p{.25\textwidth}p{.7\textwidth}}
\toprule
Input name				& API\_trackSide\_Message \\
\midrule
Description				& Track side message received from the API. The API performs preprocessing of RTM and BTM messages and deliveres a maximum of a single message per cycle. The structure of this message is defined in the API [BTM] and [EURORADIO] sections. The input consists of the following main componenets:
\begin{description}
\item[valid](bool): indicates the information has been refreshed in the cycle.
\begin{description}
\item[true]: information is updated in this cycle
\item[false]: information is unchanged.
\end{description}
\item[systemTimeMsgReceived](Obu\_BasicTypes\_Pkg::T\_internal\_Type): Timestamp when the system (i.e., the train) has received the message. The parameter is set either by RTM or by BTM modules.
\item[msg\_type](Common\_Types\_Pkg::MsgSource\_T): source of this information. 
\begin{description}
\item[msrc\_undefined]: indicates the information is not defined. This input is expected when valid flag is false.
\item[msrc\_Euroradio]: indicates the information is a euroradio message.
\item[msrc\_Eurobalise]: indicates the information is a balise telegram.
\end{description}
Other values of this enumeration are not expected in this model.
\item[btm\_msg](API\_Msg\_Pkg::API\_TelegramHeader\_T): telegram header with some additional information provided by the btm-module. The header looks like:
\begin{description}
\item[present](bool): telegram information has been received via btm and the information of this telegram is present. 
\item[checkResult](bool): the telegram is checked after reception at the btm. Typical checks are checksum-tests or checks at conversion of the types from bit-layout to the presentation in the evc. If checkResult is false the information may not be used. The information is evaluated in the checkBGConsistency component of this model.
\item[api\_bad\_balise\_received](bool): the telegram reception was disturbed. Again, the information related to this telegram may not be used in the evc.
\item[api\_header](API\_Msg\_Pkg::API\_TelegramHeader\_T) header of the telegram similar to subset 26 section 8.4.2.1. The information in the telegram is not packed on bit-boundaries.
\item[centerOfBalisePosition](BG\_Types\_Pkg::centerOfBalisePosition\_T): Location of the balise as determined by the antenna of the train. The information is extended with inaccuracies of the measurement given by the btm.
\end{description}

\item[rtm\_msg](API\_Msg\_Pkg::API\_RadioMsgHeader\_T): radio message header with some additional information added by the rtm module. The informtion looks like:
\begin{description}
\item[present](bool): radio message has been received via rtm and the information of this message is present. 
\item[apiConsistencyError](bool): the message is checked after reception at the btm. Typical checks are checksum-tests or checks at conversion of the types from bit-layout to the presentation in the evc. If apiConsistencyError is false the information may not be used. The information is evaluated in the checkRadioMessage component of this model.
\item[Radio\_Common\_Header](Radio\_Types\_Pkg::Radio\_TrackTrain\_Header\_T): header of the radio-message as defined in subset 26 section 8.4.4.6.1. In the SRS, depending on the concrete message, some optional variables are defined. In our implementation all optional variables are foreseen. In order to indicate the availability of variables the component radioMetadata is used (see below).
\item[radioMetadata](Common\_Types\_Pkg::RadioMetadata\_T): metadata for optional variables in the common radio message header. For each optional component a presence indicator of type bool is in the list.  
\item[sendingRBC\_Id](Common\_Types\_Pkg::RBC\_Id\_T): identifies the RBC as it is known at the RTM. Information is added to the interface in the RTM.
\begin{description}
\item[packets](Common\_Types\_Pkg::CompressedPackets\_T): Packets as received as a part of the telegram or radio message. The structure is set-up and can be accessed by library routines of the trackMessages component of the system. In the manage\_trackside\_Messages component packets my be changed to being absent (e.g., by the function validateDataDirection or by the Information filter.). If packets have to be treated only this valid indicator is changed. No other parts of the packets are accessed.

In situations like level-changes or announced radio holes, not the timestamp of the last message is relevant for comparison, but the timestamp of the last relevant event. This can for example be the timestamp of the level change or the timestamp of the moment, when the train was passing the end of the radiohole.

For performing this check, the timestamp of the last relevant event is provided to the model as an {T\_internal\_Type}-type. \\
